# Squash the Creeps 3D

The [your first 3D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) tutorial of Godot's documentation in Haxe using the [haxe godot externs](https://github.com/HaxeGodot/godot/).

Run `haxe build.hxml` to compile the Haxe code, then use the Godot engine to compile the project.

VSCode is configured to compile the Haxe code on save, to have a workflow similar to using C# with Godot.
